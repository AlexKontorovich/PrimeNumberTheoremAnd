Let $\nu$ be a bumpfunction.
\begin{theorem}[SmoothExistence]\label{SmoothExistence}\lean{SmoothExistence}\leanok
There exists a smooth (once differentiable would be enough), nonnegative ``bumpfunction'' $\nu$,
 supported in $[1/2,2]$ with total mass one:
$$
\int_0^\infty \nu(x)\frac{dx}{x} = 1.
$$
\end{theorem}


\begin{proof}\leanok
\uses{smooth-ury}
Same idea as Urysohn-type argument.
\end{proof}

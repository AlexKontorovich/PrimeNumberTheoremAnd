\title{Complex Analysis: Has Primitives}
\author{Rutgers Lean Seminar}

%
% This is a blueprint for the HasPrimitives project, written by the Rutgers Lean Group
% 
% This blueprint can be edited like a standard LaTeX document.
%
% There are 3 useful commands that are specific to lean:
%   * \lean{leanref}: is used in a definition, lemma or theorem, and is the
%		      name of the lean object corresponding to the definition,
%		      lemma or theorem.
%   * \leanok: is used in a lemma or theorem: marks that the lemma or theorem
%              has been fully formalized
%   * \uses{ref}: is used in a proof environment: specifies which definitions,
%                 lemma, theorems are used in the proof. Note that 'ref' is a
%                 LaTeX ref, not a lean one.

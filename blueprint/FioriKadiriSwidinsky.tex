\section{The estimates of Fiori, Kadiri, and Swidinsky}


In this section we establish the primary results of Fiori, Kadiri, and Swidinsky.


\begin{theorem}[FKS Theorem 1.2b]\label{FKS_theorem_1_2b} If $\log x_0 \geq 1000$ then we have an admissible bound for $E_\psi$ with the indicated choice of $A(x_0)$, $B = 3/2$, $C = 2$, and $R = 5.5666305$.
\end{theorem}

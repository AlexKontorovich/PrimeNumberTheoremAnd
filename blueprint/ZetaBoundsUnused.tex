It would perhaps (?) be better to refactor this entire file so that we're not using explicit
constants but instead systematically using big Oh notation... The punchline would be:


\begin{lemma}[LogDerivZetaBndAlt]\label{LogDerivZetaBndAlt}\lean{LogDerivZetaBndAlt}\leanok
There is an $A>0$ so that for $1-A/\log^9 |t| \le \sigma < 1$ and $|t|\to\infty$,
$$
|\frac {\zeta'}{\zeta} (\sigma+it)| \ll \log^9 |t|.
$$
(Same statement but using big-Oh and filters.)
\end{lemma}


\begin{proof}\leanok
\uses{LogDerivZetaBnd}
Same as above.
\end{proof}

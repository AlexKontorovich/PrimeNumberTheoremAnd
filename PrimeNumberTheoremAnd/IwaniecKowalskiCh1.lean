  (proof := /--
  Let $a$ and $b$ be coprime natural numbers, and let $d$ be a divisor of $ab$. Since $a$ and $b$ are coprime, we can use the fact that the divisors of $ab$ correspond to pairs of divisors of $a$ and $b$. Specifically, we can express $d$ as $d = d_a \cdot d_b$, where $d_a$ divides $a$ and $d_b$ divides $b$. The uniqueness of this decomposition follows from the coprimality of $a$ and $b$, which ensures that the divisors of $a$ and $b$ do not share any common factors. Therefore, there is a one-to-one correspondence between the divisors of $ab$ and the pairs of divisors of $a$ and $b$, which guarantees the uniqueness of the decomposition.

  (proof := /--
  Since $f$ is multiplicative, we can express the sum over divisors of $ab$ in terms of the sums over divisors of $a$ and $b$. The key idea is to use the fact that the divisors of $ab$ can be expressed as products of divisors of $a$ and divisors of $b$, due to the coprimality condition. Specifically, each divisor $d$ of $ab$ can be uniquely written as $d = d_a * d_b$, where $d_a$ divides $a$ and $d_b$ divides $b$. Therefore, we can rewrite the sum as a double sum over the divisors of $a$ and $b$, which factorizes into the product of the two separate sums.

    Let $m$ and $n$ be coprime natural numbers, with a fixed power $k$. The function
    $(a,b) \mapsto ab$ is injective on the product of the divisors of $m$ and $n$ that can be
    expressed as perfect $k$-powers.
  -/)
  (proof := /--
    This follows from the injectivity of the function on the product of all divisors, as shown in
    the previous lemma. Since we are restricting to a subset of the divisors, the injectivity still
    holds.

  (proof := /--
    We will show that for coprime $m$ and $n$, we have
    $\sum_{d^2|mn} \mu(d) = \sum_{d^2|m} \mu(d) \cdot \sum_{d^2|n} \mu(d)$. This follows from the
    fact that the divisors of $mn$ that are perfect squares correspond to the products of divisors
    of $m$ and $n$ that are perfect squares, as shown in the previous lemmas. The multiplicativity
    of the Möbius function then allows us to factor the sum accordingly.

  (proof := /--
    For a prime power $p^k$, note that if $k\leq 1$ then the only square divisor is $1$, so the sum
    evaluates as $\mu(1)=1$. If $k\geq 2$, then $1$ and $p^2$ are square divisors of $p^k$. Thus,
    the sum evaluates as $\mu(1)+\mu(p)+\ldots$ where the remaining terms are moebius of higher
    powers (if necessary). Since $\mu(p)=-1$ and $\mu$ of higher powers of $p$ is zero, this is
    $0$. This agrees with $\mu(p^k)^2$, which is simply an indicator function for $k\leq 1$ (i.e.
    $p^k$ is squarefree).

  The Liouville function $\lambda(n)$ is defined as $(-1)^{\Omega(n)}$, where $\Omega(n)$ is the total number of prime factors of $n$ counted with multiplicity. This means that for each prime factor of $n$, we contribute a factor of $-1$ to the product, and the overall sign of $\lambda(n)$ depends on whether the total number of prime factors is even or odd. Thus, we have $\lambda(n) = (-1)^{\Omega(n)}$ by definition.

  Let $f$ be a completely multiplicative function. To show that $f$ is multiplicative, we need to verify that $f(1) = 1$ and that $f(ab) = f(a)f(b)$ for all coprime natural numbers $a$ and $b$. Since $f$ is completely multiplicative, we have $f(1) = 1$ by definition. For coprime $a$ and $b$, we can write $ab$ as a product of prime factors, and since $f$ is completely multiplicative, it will factor as the product of the values of $f$ at those prime factors. This means that $f(ab) = f(a)f(b)$ for coprime $a$ and $b$, which shows that $f$ is multiplicative.

The Möbius function $\mu(n)$ is defined as $0$ if $n$ has a squared prime factor, and otherwise it is $(-1)^{\omega(n)}$, where $\omega(n)$ counts the number of distinct prime factors of $n$. For square-free numbers, we have $\Omega(n) = \omega(n)$, since there are no repeated prime factors. Therefore, for square-free numbers, we have $\lambda(n) = (-1)^{\omega(n)} = \mu(n)$, which shows that the Liouville function agrees with the Möbius function on square-free numbers.

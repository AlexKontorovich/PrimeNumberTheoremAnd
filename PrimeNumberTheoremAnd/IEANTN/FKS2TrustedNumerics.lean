# Trusted numerical boundaries introduced by FKS2 Corollary 23

This file collects, in one place and with **minimal imports**, the trusted numerical
`sorry`s that the formalisation of FKS2 Corollary 23 (`corollary_23_all`) **introduces**:
ten bounds on compact windows `x ∈ [eᵃ, eᵇ]`, one per Table-6 row plus a gap band for
row 8.  Each is a finite-range numerical datum taken from the published computations of

> M. Cully-Hugill, D. R. Johnston, T. S. Trudgian, A. Yang (FKS2),
> *Explicit bounds for `π(x)` and related functions* (arXiv:2206.12557).

## Scope

These ten are the trust that Corollary 23 adds *on top of* the existing development.
`corollary_23_all` additionally relies on trusted numerical `sorry`s that already live
on `main` in their own files and are **not** reproduced here:

* `Table4Ext.allCells_trusted` — the ancillary Table-4 cell data, backing the
  `[e^10, e^20000]` mid-range;
* the Büthe bounds `Buthe.theorem_2e` / `theorem_2f` — backing the `[e^5, e^10]`
  floor segments.

So `#print axioms corollary_23_all` reports `sorryAx` on account of those as well as of
the facts gathered here.

## What the facts are

For the small-`x` floor windows (rows 2–9, `x ≲ 400`) the bound is a direct finite
check: `π(x)` is an exact prime count and `Li(x) = ∫_2^x dt / log t` a certified
quadrature, so the inequality is bounded arithmetic with no analytic input.  Two
windows are of a different, still purely *tabular* character (each flagged in its own
docstring): the near-threshold row-1 window `[e^22.955, e^23.5]` (`x ≈ 10¹⁰`) rests on
FKS2's large-scale computed values of `π`, and the row-8 gap band `[e^5500, e^9500]`
rests on FKS2's *refined* Table-4 tabulation (a finer subdivision than the coarse
in-repo grid).  None is a zero-free region or an unproved asymptotic to be discharged
inside this development; each is a finite, paper-verified numerical datum.

## Auditing

To keep imports minimal this file does not import the main development; the two FKS2
abbreviations that appear below are written out here from Mathlib primitives only:

* `Epi x` is `E_π(x) = |π(x) − Li(x)| / (x / log x)` with
  `π(x) = Nat.primeCounting ⌊x⌋₊` and `Li(x) = ∫_2^x dt / log t`;
* `classicalCurve A B C R x` is the FKS2 admissible bound
  `A · (log x / R)^B · exp(−C · (log x / R)^{1/2})`.

Both are *definitionally equal* to the root-namespace `Eπ` and `admissible_bound` of the
main development (`Defs.lean`); the equality is guarded by `rfl` `example`s in
`FKS2Cor23.lean`, and the row files discharge their goals by `exact` against the lemmas
below.

`E_π(x) ≤ 1.76 · (log x / R) · exp(−1.5 · (log x / R)^{1/2})`, `R = 5.5666305`, is a

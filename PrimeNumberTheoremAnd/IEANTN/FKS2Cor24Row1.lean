# FKS2 Corollary 24 — row 1 (`2·log x·x^{-1/2}`)

`table7` entry `(x ↦ 2 * log x * x^(-1/2), Icc 1 57)`.  Clone of row 4
(`FKS2Cor24Row4.lean`), reusing the generic `x^{-1/2}`-curve machinery in
`Table4Ext` (`Epi_le_evalLhsE_wide`, `xhalfCurveE`, `eval_xhalfCurveE`,
`floor_xhalf_of_check`).

Unlike row 4/5, the Buthe floor threshold `Lf = 3` used by rows 4/5 does **not**
certify here: at `L = 3` the Buthe polynomial (`≈ 6.12`) exceeds `c·L = 2·3 = 6`.
Raised to `Lf = 4` (`√4 = 2` exactly, so the slab-cover lower endpoint needs no
irrational-sqrt bridging lemma), the floor certifies with margin from `L = 4` on.

/-! ## FKS2 Corollary 24, row 1 (`2·log x·x^{-1/2}`, `log x ∈ [1, 57]`)

The Table-7 row-1 curve, assembled from three segments split at `e^4`, `e^43`:

* **floor (checked)** `[e^1, e^4]` — direct `π`/`Li` interval enclosure for small `x`;
* **Buthe floor** `[e^4, e^43]` — `floor_xhalf_of_check` + a dyadic slab cover of `[√4, √43]
  = [2, √43]` (`slabsFrom 2 93`);
* **trusted band** `[e^43, e^57]` — Theorem-6 refined interpolation for `log x > log(10^19)`
  (trusted, `sorry`).

/-- Row-1 floor slab certificate: `FloorButhe.lhsE ≤ xhalfCurveE 2 2` (the Buthe `x^{-1/2}`
bound `≤ 2·(log x)·x^{-1/2}`) over the 93 width-`0.05` slabs covering `[2, √43]`, verified
by the dyadic interval kernel.  (At `L = 3` the Buthe polynomial `≈ 6.12 > 2·L = 6`, so the
check fails there; from `L = 4` on, `≈ 4.71 ≤ 2·L = 8`, with growing margin.) -/

interpolation for small `x` that the blueprint proof invokes
(\cite[Lemmas 5.2, 5.3]{FKS}; "checks directly for particularly small `x`", FKS2.lean:4640).
The endpoint quadrature and enclosure checks are proof-producing; the resulting finite
certificate uses the same `native_decide` boundary as the existing table checks. -/

`Eπ x ≤ 2·log x·x^{-1/2}` whenever `log x ∈ [1, 57]`.  For `x > 0` this splits into
the three segments above; for `x < 0` (possible since `log` is even) the exponent
`-(1)/2` gives `cos((-(1)/2)·π) = cos(-π/2) = 0`, so `x^{-1/2} = 0` and the RHS is `0`,
